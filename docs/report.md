## About the Data

The benchmark was conducted on datasets generated under two distinct configurations:

- **Length variability**: Arrays with increasing sizes (from 100 to 100,000 elements), using a fixed value range.

- **Value variability**: Arrays of fixed length, but varying number of distinct elements (from 10 to 1,000,000).

All arrays are generated deterministically using seed-based sampling, ensuring full reproducibility of results.

## Measurement Configuration

Execution times are measured using an adaptive method based on the system's clock resolution.  
Each sorting algorithm is tested on **100 samples per configuration**, each repeated **60 times**.

Key measurement details:

- Minimum duration (`minTime`) is calibrated to avoid timer resolution errors.
- For each sample, **median**, **interquartile range (IQR)**, and outliers are computed.
- Asymmetric error bars are used to reflect the true spread of the distribution.
